# Algorithms and Data Structures

## _The Artifact_
For this capstone course we have been asked to select artifacts from previous experience for the purpose of expanding them in complexity to showcase our proficiency in the categories of Software Engineering and Design, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.  In this section I will be presenting my proficiency in Algorithms and Data Structures by enhancing the functionality of my CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts Final Project.
For my CS340 Advanced Programming Concepts Final we were asked to create a financial reporting service for basic stock market securities information.   This reporting service is intended for use by authorized personnel for creating interactive web reports and dashboards.  For ease of accessibility, the service was automated to use MongoDB, a NoSQL document-storage system which is supported by many languages, including Java and Python via driver APIs.  The artifacts themselves are python files that facilitate the services of Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting documents from a Mongo Data Base.   

## _Inclusion of the Artifact in your ePortfolio_
I have chosen to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because while the Python artifacts performing MongoDB CRUD services by themselves are not complicated, their existence and my ability to deploy them showcase my proficiency in Data Structures and Algorithms alone. Working with databases requires a unique understanding of data structures which include lists, trees, and hash tables, among others.  To effectively run these services, one must understand how data structures work.  To enhance these artifacts, I have consolidated into one to provide a more user-friendly solution to the customer.   Consolidating them, and thus enhancing the python automation to be more efficient to the user, further shows my proficiency in creating Algorithms and Data Structures that successfully define a sequence of operations for usability and functionality that increase the customer experience.  

## Process of Enhancing Artifact.

The Create, Read, Update, and Delete (or CRUD) artifacts were created individually as python files to perform their respective services.  
Their Basic structure is as follows:

```Markdown
CLASS Service
METHOD Service MongoDB
RETURN
CLASS Main
	OBTAIN Information
	CALL Service
```
