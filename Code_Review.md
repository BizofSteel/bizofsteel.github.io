# Code Review and Plan for Artifact Enhancement

## _Aldana Code Review_

As my Code Review I created a screencast of how my artifacts work and the thinking that went into creating them.  I explain how I will be enhancing my current artifacts by providing explanations during the presentation of my artifacts.

### _I.	Software Engineering and Design_

For the Software Engineering and Design proficiency I will be expanding the complexity of my CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization Final Project.   For this project I built a Listerine bottle in C++ using OpenGL from scratch while plotting vertices on a 3-D plane and shading. One of the things I had to do for the purpose of saving time and because I was not familiar on the limits of the memory containers, I limited the number of indices and vertices I deployed.  By doing so, my bottle looks a little pixelated and the labels that I deployed look flat.  The enhancements that I will be making to this artifact will show my growth in learning how to execute work arounds to the container memory limitation I was challenged with on my first time around.  I also hope to increase the aesthetic nature of the graphics and visualization of my artifact that will make the product more appealing.

### _II. Algorithms and Data Structures_

For Algorithms and Data Structures I plan to enhance my CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts Final Project as my artifact of choice.  My enhancement plan includes improving efficiency by consolidating the different Python Files used for CRUD functionality into one.  By enhancing this artifact this way, my skills in lean coding and complicated algorithm knowledge should be evident.  The data structure for the one file will require a more sophisticated algorithm for deployment of CRUD services which will look like the pseudocode below.

```markdown
CLASS Create
        METHOD Create MongoDB
        RETURN
CLASS Read
        METHOD Read MongoDB
        RETURN
CLASS Update
        METHOD Update MongoDB
        RETURN
CLASS Delete
        METHOD Delete MongoDB
        RETURN
UBTAIN Service Desired
        IF Service CREATE
              CALL CLASS Create
        ELSEIF Service READ
              CALL CLASS Read
        ELSEIF Service UPDATE
              CALL CLASS Update
        ELSEIF Service DELETE
              CALL CLASS Delete
        ENDIF
```


### _III.	Category Three: Databases_

For the Database proficiency I also plan to use my CS 340 Final Project as my artifact of choice.  As an enhancement I am  adding more advanced concepts of MySQL to the enhancement that I am creating for the CRUD functionality.  This will involve deploying more sophisticated querying techniques that will include pipelines in MongoDB that will enhance mining for specific data.  The skills in deploying these pipeline will showcase my in depth understanding of working with databases and my knowledge on how to find specific information found within, a skill that not only helps when working with data bases but also within the data mining field as well.
