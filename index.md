# _Professional Self-Assessment_

In my Professional Self-Assessment, I reflect on my experiences with the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University as a whole and how it has shaped my professional goals and values and prepared me to expand my career into the computer science field. I also reflect on the Computer Science Capstone and the Artifact Enhancement work done within the Final Project to showcase my proficiency in Software Design, Software Engineering, Algorithms, Data Structures, and Databases.  

## _Introduction_

I began my career in 2007 as a Mechanical Engineer working in the Elevator Industry.   I spent a couple of years working in applications which allowed me to learn products inside and out.   I then moved into Research and Development, and for the next 5 years worked on new product development.  A major lesson that I learned during my time of product development and that is now second nature is to be disciplined in the methodology of Design for Manufacturing and Assembly.  DFMA is an engineering methodology that focuses on reducing time-to-market and total production costs by prioritizing both the ease of manufacture for the product's parts and for simplified assembly.  I find this methodology to be relevant in many aspects as a professional, not only in design, but in project, people, and time management. 

After my educational time in R&D I moved into a prominent Engineering Management role which provided me an opportunity to work on processes automation and manufacturing.   It is here where my interest in Computer Science began to grow.  Robotics and mechanical automation are a key area of where I work today.  In a world where everything needs to move quicker but be as precise and efficient as ever, robotics is key. Where assembly would require 6-8 people to complete output for a full day, one robot may be programmed to do the same if not more and allowed to work overnight without worry of labor costs.  If for nothing else, robotics helps us stay competitive and keep manufacturing state side since we cannot compete with low wages.  That said, computer science has helped me understand how to be more efficient and effective with these designs but has also helped me with being a better leader and manager.

I enrolled in the Computer Science program at SNHU in the summer of 2017 and have managed to squeeze the curriculum aside my full-time duties as an Engineering Manager, a Father of two toddlers, and a Husband.  I plan to continue to grow in my field and move more towards a larger project management role.   I know that my time in the computer science field has not only given me the extra ammo necessary to achieve greater heights but also has helped me stay up to speed in relevant technology in the field of computers and software.   Staying relevant with new technology is something that I plan to do for the rest of my life.
## _Computer Science Capstone_

As a Final Project, the Computer Science Capstone required us to identify artifacts of interest that we could enhance to showcase our proficiency in Software Design, Software Engineering, Algorithms, Data Structures, and Databases.  

### _Software Design and Engineering_

To showcase proficiency in Software Design and Engineering, I chose to expand the complexity of my CS-330: Computational Graphics and Visualization Final Project.  The artifact was heavy in C++ programming and involved the deployment of OpenGL, a cross-platform application programming interface for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.   As a Final, I built a Listerine bottle from scratch while plotting vertices on a 3-D plane and shading. One of the things I had to do for the purpose of saving time and because I was not familiar on the limits of the memory containers, I limited the number of indices and vertices I deployed.  By doing so, my bottle looked a little pixelated.  

The purpose of the final was not to deliver refined graphics but to show proficiency in working with OpenGL.   The time limitation of the Final and my new familiarity with OpenGL left a lot to be desired.   The enhancements made to the artifact as part of my Capstone Final thereafter allowed me to show my growth in Software Design by executing work arounds to the container memory limitation, and to showcase my Engineering aptitude by increasing the aesthetic nature of the graphics and visualization of my artifact that made the product more appealing.

### _Algorithms and Data Structures_

To showcase proficiency in Algorithms and Data Structures, I expanded my CS-340 Advanced
Programming Concepts Final Project which worked on automating MongoDB querying services with Python.  The original final relied on various Python files that were designed to provide the querying services to the user.   The issue here was that for every service, a different file would need to be deployed which made the activity of querying cumbersome.  My enhancement to these artifacts improved efficiency and user experience by consolidating the different Python Files used for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality into One.  These enhancements show proficiency in skills in lean coding and complicated algorithm knowledge as the data structure for the one Python file required a more sophisticated algorithm for deployment of CRUD service.

### _Databases_

For the Databases category, I also expanded my CS-340 Advanced Programming Concepts Final Project.  As an enhancement I added advanced concepts of MySQL which involved deploying sophisticated aggregation pipelines and querying techniques in MongoDB that will enhance mining for specific data.  I developed this functionality in a way that not only made the artifact scalable, but also increased repeatability, user experience and efficiency.  The skills in deploying these pipelines not only showcases my in depth understanding of working with databases but also solidifies my proficiency in Data Structures and Computer Science as a whole.  

## Weight Tracker for Android
This weight tracking app is used to track the daily weight of a user and show progress. The app is deployed with a database using the integrated SQLite functionality so that it can store login information, daily weight activity and goals. It includes a log in screen with new user registration and password reset functionality to provide users with easy profile management. Next the Main Activity (Home Screen) is a dashboard which includes a current weight display with relational target goal. There are navigational buttons that allow the user to enter Current and Target weights which are recorded with Date/Time stamps.

I followed a simplicity principle and worked to not over complicating things.   TO be successful in this, a developer must harness the technology available to make the user experience easy.   For this we tied internal memory to different areas of the UI and tied activities to the user experience that make the overall usability of the application easy and pleasurable.

## _Peace of Mind_

I grew a lot, as a person and as a professional, through my experiences in the Computer Science Program at Southern New Hampshire University.   

As a person I have expanded my capacity.   I have learned that I am able to handle many different projects, many different stresses, at the same time.  I have expanded my capacity to time manage them, remain reliable, and stay successful.  I weigh myself in this regard by not only the successes I have experienced in my professional career but also as a Father, a Husband, a Son, and a Friend.  

As a professional I have deployed many practices that I have learned in this program.  At work I am overseeing the implementation of a new CPQ and ERP system where I have implemented Agile Scrum to deploy the product through an iterative process.  The same that I learned in my first year at SNHU.   I am in the process of developing a simple Android App that will allow our customers to perform product specification surveys digitally and direct them towards our company directly from the mobile devices.  I am developing this in Android Studio which I learned during my time in CS-360 Mobile Architect & Programming and which I plan to include in this portfolio soon.

A lot of what I have learned through this journey I have applied to life.  I am in a unique position to deploy these concepts real time and to see the fruits of their labor right away.   I plan to keep a principle that I learned early on, which is to stay relevant.  To take ownership of oneself, to be mindful of others, and to stay relevant to technology and innovation as an Engineer.
